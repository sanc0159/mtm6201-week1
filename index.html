            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Verónica Sánchez Guerra, I was born 26 years ago in Medellín, also known as the city of eternal spring in Colombia. I like cats, tattoos, 90s-2000s pop music and taking long walks without a planned destination, I feel most alive when I'm laughing or strongly focused on a task, as I love feeling useful.
            I graduated as a Product Design Engineer back in Colombia and worked for a few years in marketing and packaging until I decided to pursue a new dream in Canada. Now I'm looking for new challenges and knowledge in some fields I've always been interested in, like videography and web design, and hope to make it in the industry producing valuable content for different projects or companies.
            </p>
